<h3 id="_about_the_ogc"><a class="anchor" href="#_about_the_ogc"></a>1.1. About the OGC</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is an international consortium of organizations and individuals driven to make geospatial (location) information and services FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. More information is available on the <a href="https://www.ogc.org/">OGC website</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC was formed to undertake a common objective that is beyond the resources or capabilities of any single organization, that is,  to provide a collaborative, consensus forum for the discussion and resolution of interoperability issues in the geospatial domain. The work of the consortium is based on volunteerism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC is defined as a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/revised_circular_a-119_as_of_01-22-2016.pdf">Voluntary Consensus Standards Organization</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_this_policies_and_procedures_document"><a class="anchor" href="#_this_policies_and_procedures_document"></a>1.2. This Policies and Procedures Document</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC provides a collaborative, consensus process for developing and approving open, international Standards and supporting content for the geospatial domain, collectively known as OGC Products. To guide the OGC Product development and approval process, a member-approved Policies and Procedures document for the Technical Committee (TC) is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document describes the TC Policies and Procedures (TC PnP). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/files/6947">OGC Bylaws</a>. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the needs and purpose of the TC change, changes to these policies and procedures are approved by an electronic vote of the Voting Members of the OGC TC. These policies and procedures may be augmented or clarified by Policy Directives issued and approved by the TC or the PC. Such directives are databased and hyperlinked to/from the appropriate portion of this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC <a href="https://www.ogc.org/ogc/policies/conduct">Principles of Conduct</a> govern personal and public interactions in any TC activity.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document is organized to first describe the structure and policies for the TC and its subgroups, then to describe the specific process by which OGC Documents and Products are developed and approved per the policies. Because many processes are shared by subgroups and Product lifecycles, cross-references within this document are provided to minimize duplication of content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TC PnP is supported by additional resources to refine or implement policy.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="policy-directives"><a class="anchor" href="#policy-directives"></a>2.1. Policy Directives</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At times, the Technical or Planning Committees may identify new policies or changes to existing policies that should be made official on a more rapid basis than approval of a revision to a policy document. Such a new policy is known as a Policy Directive. Policy Directives are accessible from the OGC website <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php">Policy Directives database</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Policy Directives are sequentially ordered and more recent Directives may invalidate older Directives. Further, older Directives may now be incorporated into these Policies and Procedures.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="dwg"><a class="anchor" href="#dwg"></a>4.2.1. Domain Working Groups</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A DWG is a group of individuals composed of members of the TC and invited guests with the specific intent of discussing and/or solving some particular problem or problems in a particular domain or technology arena for recommendation to the TC. Key functions of the DWG are to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>have a formal approved charter that defines the DWG&#8217;s scope of activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a forum for discussion and documentation of interoperability requirements for a given information or user community;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a forum to discuss and recommend document actions;</p>

<li>
<p>develop documents with the intent seeking approval by the TC for release of these documents as OGC Technical Papers, Discussion Papers, or Best/Community Practices;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hold meetings with informational presentations and discussions about the market use of adopted OGC Standards; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have missions and goals defined by the TC.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A DWG does not work on OGC Standards process submissions, candidate Standards, or revisions to existing OGC Standards. However, a DWG can develop change requests as documented interoperability requirements that can then be submitted as work items to a SWG. A DWG may initiate an activity that becomes realized as a new SWG.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, a DWG will allow public collaboration, such as in teleconference, email discussions, or in <a href="#collaboration-environment">Collaboration environments</a>. A DWG has the option to make a motion to the TC to remove public participation in the DWG.</p>

<h3 id="_subcommittees"><a class="anchor" href="#_subcommittees"></a>4.3. Subcommittees</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A subcommittee (SC) is a standing group of individuals composed of members of the TC and invited guests, with a mission to provide recommendations to the TC in some general area. A Subcommittee does not generate a Standard nor does it work on a Standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SCs are long-standing entities with general portfolios or missions. OGC staff can chair SCs. Any OGC member can attend a SC meeting and participate.</p>

<h4 id="_ogc_naming_authority"><a class="anchor" href="#_ogc_naming_authority"></a>4.3.1. OGC Naming Authority</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) controls the assignment of OGC Names to resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. In the terminology defined in ISO 19135-1:2015, OGC-NA is the Control Body for the registry of OGC Names: the OGC Definitions Server. The registry consists of multiple registers, each focuses on a specific aspect of a domain. As many OGC Standards and other products include reference to or use of registered content, the OGC-NA works directly with the owning groups of those products in publication of resources. There are separate <a href="https://www.ogc.org/standards/na">OGC-NA Policies and Procedures</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_document_team"><a class="anchor" href="#_document_team"></a>4.3.2. Document Team</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Document Team (DocTeam) works with OGC staff and OGC members to define, enforce, and educate OGC members on documentation guidelines (format, templates, style) within the OGC. The DocTeam also works with OGC staff and OGC members to manage the document publishing infrastructure used by OGC.</p>

<h4 id="ad-hoc-meetings"><a class="anchor" href="#ad-hoc-meetings"></a>4.5.1. Ad-hoc meeting(s)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any group of OGC members can schedule and advertise an ad-hoc meeting. The interested members develop a basic agenda and draft scope for the work of the group and call for an ad-hoc meeting at a scheduled TC event or by teleconference/webinar. At this ad-hoc meeting, the participants continue to frame the mission and the scope for a proposed new subgroup. Participants determine whether there is adequate OGC member interest to actually form a new subgroup.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_cosi_initiatives"><a class="anchor" href="#_cosi_initiatives"></a>4.5.2. COSI initiatives</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A COSI initiative may be structured to investigate or prototype a draft specification that could form that basis for an OGC candidate Standard. In such cases, the initiative leader(s) can notify the TC of the intent to develop a draft specification and begin work on a SWG charter. Such a notification allows OGC members to observe the initiative work and be more informed of the potential for standardization as an outcome of the work.</p>

<p>The primary function of the ad-hoc meetings is to write a charter for the new subgroup. The charter documents the mission, scope, roles, and responsibilities of the proposed subgroup. Drafts of the charter can be shared with other members for review and comment. The templates for the DWG and SWG Charter documents can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/opengeospatial/templates">templates GitHub repository</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Charters can also be drafted during the execution of COSI initiative without the requirement of holding an ad-hoc meeting as the initiative meetings will serve the same purpose.</p>

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the TC Chair judges the changes to reflect a natural progression of the subgroup work, then the TC Chair shall notify the full membership of the proposed changes.

<p>The formation and execution of the work of a SWG is closely tied to the OGC Intellectual Property Policies. Members are strongly encouraged to read this Policy prior to forming or joining a SWG.</p>

<h4 id="the-swg-charter"><a class="anchor" href="#the-swg-charter"></a>4.13.1. SWG Charter and Task approval process</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever a SWG needs to be formed, the first order of business is to inform the TC Chair. The TC Chair will discuss the process and next steps. The submission team then writes a SWG Charter following the subgroup <a href="#subgroup-charter-process">Charter process</a> and additional rules for a SWG, as below. The Charter documents the scope of work, references, business value, and projected timeline for the new SWG. SWG are chartered to create a primary delivery (a new Standard), maintain that Standard, and optionally update, extend, or profile that Standard through a <a href="#swg-task-process">SWG Task approval process</a>. At a minimum, the scope of the primary delivery is provided in the SWG charter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each SWG to be formed must agree to develop Standards that are Reasonable And Non-Discriminatory (RAND) Royalty Free per the <a href="https://www.ogc.org/about/ipr">OGC Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policies</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="persistent-swgs"><a class="anchor" href="#persistent-swgs"></a>Persistent SWGs</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, OGC SWGs are persistent until the SWG elects to become inactive or disband. Persistence supports the ability to maintain the Standard products of the SWG, work on multiple revisions of an existing OGC Standard, or to ensure that long-term collaboration with other SWGs can be maintained. There may be reasons why a SWG is chartered not to be persistent and such reasons must be described in the charter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a SWG completes its primary delivery, each new proposed SWG deliverable under its in-force charter shall be approved via the <a href="#swg-task-process">SWG Task approval process</a>.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="swg-to-dwg-relationship"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-to-dwg-relationship"></a>SWG to DWG Relationship(s)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the chartering of a new SWG, a "home" or "parent" DWG must be identified to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>be a forum for non-IPR-protected discussion of requirements that are relevant to the SWG&#8217;s work;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>determine when an inactive SWG needs to reactivate to correct or revise a Standard created by the SWG; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work with the TC Chair to address the situation where OGC members are unable or unwilling to reactivate the SWG.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SWG charter submitters must seek approval from the proposed home DWG for that DWG to function as the home. The DWG may approve this request using the normal DWG voting process. The home DWG must approve the relationship and be identified in the proposed SWG charter prior to the approval of that charter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, a SWG is proposed to be formed at the same time as its home DWG is proposed. Under such circumstances, the proposed home DWG is identified in the SWG charter and is effective only if both WGs are approved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should either or both the SWG and the DWG wish to change the parent relationship for a SWG, both WGs shall approve dissolution of the relationship through respective votes and the SWG shall identify and seek approval of a new home DWG.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="swg-charter-approval-and-formation"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-charter-approval-and-formation"></a>SWG Charter Approval and Formation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TC Chair will work with members to write the draft SWG Charter. Once a draft is completed, the charter review and approval process as defined in <a href="#approval-of-a-subgroup-charter">Approval of a subgroup charter</a> shall be followed. For the purposes of charter development and approval, consider that the ad-hoc group and a submission team are equivalent in that a submission team is an ad-hoc group.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="swg-task-process"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-task-process"></a>SWG Task approval process</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any new work from a SWG after the primary deliverable must be approved by the TC as a new Task prior to start of that work. The new work can result in a new Standard or an update, extension, or profile of a Standard managed by the SWG.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposed Task must be presented to the TC at a plenary. Otherwise, a presentation will be developed and posted to the Portal. This presentation should cover the key aspects of the Task, especially the scope of work, the timeline, and the technical discussion related how the work relates to the Standard(s) developed by the SWG.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the proposed Task has been presented to the TC, the TC Chair will initiate a 21 day TC and public review of the proposed Task. If comments are received in the review period, the SWG shall consider the comments and reissue the proposed Task details, if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The proposed Task will be voted upon by TC Voting Members in a Closing Plenary or by a two-week email vote (see <a href="#voting-forum">Voting forum and process</a>). Once approved, the Task will be added to the SWG Charter and the updated Charter posted to the SWG Portal files. The SWG may now begin work on the Task.</p>

<h4 id="swg-participation"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-participation"></a>4.13.2. Participating in a SWG (opting in and out)</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any OGC member representative can join a SWG at any time and participate in the work of the SWG. If a member wishes to participate, then the member representative must “opt-in” to the new SWG. Opting into a SWG is done via a registration page for that SWG. The registration page is available on the OGC Portal. The registration page will clearly state the IPR terms for the SWG as well as the Scope of Work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the member representative does elect to participate (opt-in), then there is a 30-day period during which the member representative can participate but cannot vote. During this 30-day period, the member representative can also elect to opt-out of the SWG and not be required to declare any IPR or essential claims.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Charter members of the SWG have opted-in to the SWG by agreeing to the SWG charter at the time of its publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Opting-out of a SWG:</strong> during the 30-day waiting period, any member representative may elect to opt-out of a SWG without having the Member having to declare any Necessary Claims. A member representative can opt-out by notifying the TC Chair.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="swg-member-types"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-member-types"></a>4.13.3. Member types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="#subgroup-roles">Roles in a subgroup</a> apply to SWGs. However, SWG members can be further divided into three categories:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Charter member: a Charter member of a SWG supports the chartering of the SWG and agree to be a voting participant at the time of formation of the SWG;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voting member: a Voting member has opted-in to the SWG (see <a href="#swg-participation">Participating in a SWG (opting in and out)</a>) and, at least 30 days after opting-in, informed the SWG chair that they wish to be a Voting member; Voting members must stay in good standing per the rules for <a href="#swg-voting">SWG voting</a>; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group Observer: a Group Observer is a non-voting member of the SWG, either because they have only recently opted-in or because they have not requested voting status; Group Observers cannot vote on any items in the SWG, but may express their opinions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="responsibilities-of-the-swg-chair"><a class="anchor" href="#responsibilities-of-the-swg-chair"></a>4.13.4. Responsibilities of the SWG Chair</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the subgroup chair responsibilities as outlined for subgroup <a href="#subgroup-chair">Chairs</a>, the SWG Chair is responsible for organizing the activities of the SWG, including the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintaining SWG member status on the Portal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that issues are logged into the <a href="#subgroup-work-environment">Subgroup work environment</a> and these issues are prioritized and put into a roadmap for completion of a Standard. Further, that the chair ensures that the pertinent Standard roadmap is updated, agreed by consensus of the SWG members, and posted at least for each regularly scheduled TC meeting time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that <a href="#submission-of-change-request-proposals">Submission of Change Request Proposals</a> to OGC&#8217;s <a href="http://ogc.standardstracker.org/">Public Change Request</a> page are processed, including transferring the issues to the <a href="#subgroup-work-environment">Subgroup work environment</a>, if relevant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Failure of the chair to provide these capabilities will result in the removal of the chair and the election of a new chair. If no suitable chair can be located, then the work of the SWG will be considered to be non-critical and the SWG will be inactivated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="swg-voting"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-voting"></a>4.13.5. SWG voting</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SWGs operate under the same general rules as other subgroups of the TC, except that quorum is 1/2 of active voting members unless the SWG votes to have a larger fraction be quorum.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="caveat-on-voting-rights-non-participation-on-a-regular-basis"><a class="anchor" href="#caveat-on-voting-rights-non-participation-on-a-regular-basis"></a>Caveat on Voting Rights – non-participation on a regular basis</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any member of a SWG who has voting privileges has a responsibility to participate in the meeting and email dialogues. Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Ensuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face-to-face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall lose their voting privileges and have their SWG member status changed from “Voting” to “Group Observer.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. A voting member can ask to change their status to "Observer" and still actively participate in the SWG.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="cross-swg-communication"><a class="anchor" href="#cross-swg-communication"></a>4.13.6. Cross SWG communication</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many technical issues discussed in a SWG will require collaboration and communication with other SWGs. As long as the voting members agree to such cross SWG communication, then an open dialogue between two or more SWGs can occur on any specific technical issue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="swg-record-keeping"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-record-keeping"></a>4.13.7. SWG record-keeping</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SWGs are expected to maintain their Portal records in a complete fashion, including presentations made at SWG meetings. Presentations in TC Meetings which the SWG permits to be viewed by general OGC membership should be stored in the TC Meeting folder for that SWG or in the SWG Portal project files with a symbolic link to the TC Meeting folder. All draft documents for SWG discussion should be in the SWG files until that point those documents are to be discussed in the TC. SWG documents for TC discussion or voting are to be uploaded to Pending Documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="swg-use-of-collaboration-environments"><a class="anchor" href="#swg-use-of-collaboration-environments"></a>SWG use of collaboration environments</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SWGs are free to use collaboration environments such as GitHub to store content of their candidate Standard, link that content to developing code, track issues, and manage the document development workflow and milestones. A SWG may also vote to allow non-OGC members to participate in the development of the Standard in the collaboration environment. Note that such a vote does not grant access to non-members to the OGC Portal nor does it give those non-members voting rights for SWG approval of any work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The collaboration environment will be under ultimate control of the OGC. For example, OGC maintains organizational structures in GitHub and GitLab under which SWGs can create a project for their use. Non-OGC private repositories or projects may not be used for development of SWG deliverables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The collaboration environment must clearly display a message on its home page (e.g., the README file in GitHub) that states the contributions to the work in the collaboration environment belong to OGC, as shown below.</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The contributor understands that any contributions, if accepted by the OGC Membership, shall be incorporated into OGC Standards documents and that all copyright and intellectual property shall be vested to the OGC.</p>

<h4 id="public-release-of-swg-documents"><a class="anchor" href="#public-release-of-swg-documents"></a>4.13.8. Public Release of SWG documents</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any time, the SWG voting members may agree to release any SWG in-progress technical document into a public forum or to another Standards organization for comment. Such an action requires a formal SWG motion and SWG vote as per <a href="#swg-voting">SWG voting</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any time, the SWG can vote to release an in-progress candidate Standard for public comment. Please remember that there is the official formal 30-day public comment period. However, a SWG is permitted to release an in-progress document early in the process in order to solicit input from the community. If a SWG votes to release a document for early public comment, it must coordinate with the TC Chair to generate a press release and properly create the Request For Comments (RFC) on the OGC website.</p>

<p>OGC operates as a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/revised_circular_a-119_as_of_01-22-2016.pdf">Voluntary Consensus Standards Organization</a>. All actions that must be recorded as part of advancing work in OGC through its various review and approval stages require votes, either at the subgroup or TC level. Many of the actions that are performed to get to those vote stages, however, occur through <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7282">"Rough Consensus"</a> as described by the IETF.</p>

<p>OGC subgroups and the TC work through technical issues by discussion: verbally, in email, tracked in GitHub issues, etc. Such discussions do not always have unanimous agreement, but when the chair or leaders of the discussion see general agreement, then the topic can be closed and the group can move ahead. There are no hard and fast rules to close a topic: the decision is left to the expertise of the chair or discussion leader.

See <a href="#Table-1">Vote types and allowed voters</a> for voting criteria.</p>

<p>The chair(s) ask if there is any discussion on the motion. Time is allocated for discussion, but if none occurs, then the motion continues.

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Normative view - the format that has been in use for all of OGC publication history (with some minor modifications) and that is similar to the format of ISO Standards. This format is considered the authoritative representation of the Standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementer views - one or more publication styles of the Standard content that is more accessible to software engineers or data professionals. The views may be published via developer frameworks, such as SwaggerHub or ReDoc.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>OGC uses a multi-track Standards policy with three possible states: OGC Community Standard, OGC Draft Standard, and OGC Standard. These are described in <a href="#the-two-track-Standards-process-characteristics">The Two Track Standards process: characteristics</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Standards are further categorized as follows (see <a href="#annex-a-terms-and-definitions">Annex A: Terms and Definitions</a> for details):
* Abstract Specification
* Conceptual Model
* Encoding
* Implementation</p>

<p>Many OGC Standards are structured with modular sets of requirements (or requirement classes) that collectively function as a reusable building block.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building blocks developed for one Standard can be reused in another Standard. To facilitate such reuse, a Standard constructed of building blocks shall identify each building block and publish a definition of the building block to OGC&#8217;s <a href="#registries">Registries</a> and web resources. The definition will be in the form most suitable for the type of building block (e.g., Open API for a Standardized API), reference the owning Standard, and be adequately documented to be used in reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OGC Standards that reuse building blocks from other Standards must include in the Normative References a reference to the owning Standard of the building block(s) and a direct reference to the registered building block(s) content. In this fashion, implementers of the Standard reusing these building blocks need to only access specific parts (the building blocks) of the referenced Standard, not the entire document.</p>

<p><strong>Community Standard</strong>: This is a document, developed by communities external to the OGC, that OGC members wish to bring into the OGC process. The key consideration for a Community Standard submission is that there is very strong evidence of implementation. At the same time, the community owning the Standard may not want to allow normative changes (except for errors) to the document, may not wish to follow the OGC Modular Specification Policy, nor do they wish to develop CITE tests. <a href="#annex-c-community-standard-checklist">Annex C: Community Standard adoption checklist</a> summarizes the steps in the Community Standard submission, review, and approval process.</p>

However, the members wish to approve the document as an official OGC document in order to have developers and organizations implement the Draft Standard and provide feedback. A Draft Standard is uplifted to a Standard once evidence for implementation is provided. <a href="#annex-b-standard-checklist">Annex B: OGC Consensus Standards adoption checklist</a> summarizes the steps in the Draft Standard submission, review, and approval process.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Evidence of implementation</strong>: The TC will judge whether the evidence of implementation for a particular Standard is sufficient to warrant approval of that Standard. Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community Standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the Standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a Standard in the Full Standards track is defined as three or more documented implementations that meet the Nature of implementation criteria, below. The TC may choose to override the minimum number of implementations for a specific candidate Standard by specifying a lesser number in the electronic adoption vote.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Nature of implementation</strong>: Implementation Standards shall have as evidence of implementation running services which deliver content to another machine (including client software). Encoding Standards shall have as evidence of implementation data sets containing content representative of the Standard, but not necessarily containing an example of every element in the Standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Conceptual model evidence of implementation</strong>: a Standard that is conceptual in nature (e.g., cannot be implemented directly) and not being advanced as an Abstract Specification Topic shall only be advanced from a Draft to a final stage once at least one implementation Standard based on the conceptual model is approved at the Draft stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Abstract Specification Topics</strong>: these Standards do not require evidence of implementation due to their foundational nature. Abstract Specification Topics are approved as Standards without a Draft stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Modular Specification</strong>: compliance with the Modular Specification is evidenced by inclusion of clearly defined Requirements and an Abstract Test Suite in the Standard document. The OAB will evaluate a Standard against this criterion.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>IPR</strong>: Community Standard may contain IPR that is jointly held by the OGC and the submitting organization. The Full Standards track requires that OGC hold the IPR.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All OGC Standards are managed in a lifecycle of development-publication-revision and perhaps eventual retirement. The governing principles of lifecycle management for Standards are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring relevance of the active Standards;</p>

<li>
<p>practical and logical maintenance of previous editions of Standards, where appropriate; and</p>

<p>No two Standards are ever likely to follow identical timelines for their lifecycles.

The TC will manage the lifecycle of Standards in accordance with the following policies and procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="versioning"><a class="anchor" href="#versioning"></a>9.1. Versioning</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OGC Standards (and Best and Community Practices) are versioned according to <a href="https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php">Policy Directive 18</a>, which follows the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)</a>. The guidelines for version/revision numbers for documents are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only approved OGC Standards have document numbers 1.0.0 or greater. The first approved version of an OGC Standard shall be version 1.0.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corrigendum releases shall NOT result in any change to the major/minor number. If the Standard being revised has schema, then the schema shall use the version attribute to document the revision number at the third level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Revisions to an adopted Standard typically result in a change to the minor number. For example, the first revision to an adopted 1.0 Standard would be 1.1.0. Minor revision releases should be 100% backwards compatible with the previous version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to the major version number are reserved for when there are significant changes to the adopted Standard or when backwards compatibility cannot be maintained with the previous version.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Building blocks may undergo their own lifecycle of development. A change to a building block results in a revision (and thus new version) of its owning Standard. Each building block is individually versioned, but cannot be versioned higher than the owning Standard.</p>

The TC Chair will put requests for earlier review to a TC vote (all members) via the <a href="#voting-forum">Voting forum and process</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>The list of Standards will be released for 30-day TC and public review. The review request will include download statistics for each document to be reviewed.</p>
