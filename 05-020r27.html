<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/">OGC</a> provides a collaborative, consensus process for developing and approving open, international standards for the geospatial domain. “International standards”<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> are those adopted by an international standardizing/standards organization and made available to the public. Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To guide an open standards development and approval process, a member approved Policies and Procedures is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This document describes the OGC Technical Committee (TC) policies and procedures (P&amp;P). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC. The Technical Committee Chair (TCC - see <a href="#role-of-the-technical-committee-chair-tcc">Role of the Technical Committee Chair (TCC)</a>) facilitates the TC process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The TC P&amp;P:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documents all TC voting processes and procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the formation, scope and processes required for TC subgroup and committee activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the processes and procedures for submitting, reviewing, and approving a new standard using the Request for Comment procedures; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the process for revisions to adopted OGC<sup>®</sup> standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the needs and purpose of the TC change, these policies and procedures changes are approved by an electronic vote of the Voting Members of OGC TC or by recommendation of the OGC Planning Committee (PC). These policies and procedures may be augmented or clarified by Policy Directives issued and approved by the TC or the PC. Such directives are databased and hyperlinked to/from the appropriate portion of this document.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC Technical Committee provides an open, collaborative forum for professional discussion related to the consensus development and/or evaluation, approval, and revision of OGC international standards. The primary use of approved OGC standards is to provide the ability to build and deploy interoperable geospatial solutions in the larger Information Technology (IT) domain.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A broad definition of a consortium is: a combination or group of organizations formed to undertake a common objective that is beyond the resources or capabilities of any single organization. The OGC was formed to provide a collaborative, consensus forum for the discussion and resolution of interoperability issues in the geospatial domain. The work of the consortium is based on volunteerism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More specifically in the standards area, a consortium has the following characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>May or may not have been accredited by any national or global entity;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is usually (but not always) international in membership and objectives;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May have a very narrow or a broad mission (but still generally within a single focus area);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has as its primary goal(s) the creation and/or promotion of international standards (most commonly in the IT area);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creates what would be acknowledged to be "open" standards made available on Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing/">RAND</a>) terms; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May engage in additional activities, such as the creation of white papers, training and certification, but which rarely becomes a "trade association" in the non-tax sense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC is defined as a Voluntary Consensus Standards Organization<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC Corporate bylaws state that the OGC Technical Committee (TC) shall be responsible for developing standards<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> through a cooperative consensus process involving the Members. The bylaws provide authority to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design and maintain an <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/docs/as/">Abstract Specification</a> for a computing technology independent application environment for interoperable geo-processing and geospatial data products;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the Abstract Specification as a reference to solicit, propose, review, recommend revisions to, and recommend adoption of standards, also known as OGC standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide the forum for discussing, reviewing, and adopting changes to existing approved OGC standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept, discuss, review, and recommend action on documents developed in the OGC <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/programs/ip/">Innovation Program</a> and then submitted to the TC;</p>

<li>
<p>Discuss, review, and recommend action with regard to standards and relevant standards developed in other standards organizations; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss and agree on requirements, use cases, and change requests to existing OGC standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above all, the TC provides an open forum for professional discussion of issues and items related to the consensus development and/or evaluation and approval of candidate standards and revisions to existing adopted OGC standards that provide the ability to build and deploy interoperable geospatial solutions in the larger IT domain. The OGC Principles of Conduct<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup> govern personal and public interactions in any TC activity.</p>

For these votes, only one individual may vote on behalf of each such Member organization. There is no limit to the number of TC members that may represent each OGC member organization at TC meetings. However, the TCC may limit the number of attendees (on a maximum-per-organization basis) for reasons of meeting space or other operational considerations.</p>

The TC members are responsible for the development and maintenance of all standards and related technical documents. The TC membership includes Voting TC Members, non-voting TC Members, and Invited Guests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Technical Committee is comprised of three primary subgroups: the OGC Naming Authority, Working Groups (WG), and Subcommittees (SC) to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Evaluate and provide guidance on architecture issues;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carry out the development of new proposals<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup>;</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The OGC Naming Authority (OGC-NA) controls the assignment of OGC Names to resources of interest in geographic information infrastructures. In the terminology defined in ISO 19135-1:2015, OGC-NA is the Control Body for the register of OGC Names: this document describes the framework of documents, registers and other resources required for OGC-NA to execute that role. There are separate OGC-NA Policies and Procedures.</p>

<h3 id="subcommittee-sc-of-the-tc"><a class="anchor" href="#subcommittee-sc-of-the-tc"></a>4.2. Subcommittee (SC) of the TC</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A standing group (organizationally, a subgroup of the TC) of individuals composed of members of the TC and Invited Guests, with a mission to provide recommendations to the TC in some general area. A <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/sc/">Subcommittee</a> does not generate a standard nor does it work on a standard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SCs have Voting TC Member-only voting. As with all OGC groups, each Voting TC Member has only one vote per SC. SCs are long-standing entities with general portfolios or mission. OGC staff can chair TC SCs. Any OGC member can attend a SC meeting and participate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A SC may be proposed by any TC member. The TCC shall determine whether the SC should be established and whether a charter is necessary.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A group (organizationally, a subgroup of the TC) of individuals composed of members of the TC and invited guests, with the specific intent of solving some particular interoperability problem or problems in a particular technology domain for recommendation to the TC. A Group is not a subcommittee as outlined by the Bylaws of the OGC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two types of Working Groups in the TC: <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/wg/">Domain Working Groups</a> (DWGs) and <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/swg/">Standards Working Groups</a> (SWGs). The reason that there are two different type of Working Groups is due to the OGC Intellectual Property Policy.

Meetings shall be facilitated by the TCC or other appointed representative(s) of the OGC. The planning goal is to have four meetings per year. The number of meetings per year can be changed by a vote of the TC and the PC or by direction of the Board of Directors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TC meeting dates and locations will be announced as far in advance as possible but no less than four months in advance of the meeting. Announcements will be through formal OGC Communication.

<h3 id="attendance-at-tc-meetings"><a class="anchor" href="#attendance-at-tc-meetings"></a>5.2. Attendance at TC Meetings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only members of the OGC, Invited Speakers, and Invited Guests are welcome at TC meetings. Any TC member may send another representative of his or her organization as a substitute to a TC meeting (please note <a href="#proxy-for-voting">Proxy for Voting</a>). Subgroups may only meet by being formally scheduled by the TCC or designee during the course of regularly scheduled TC meetings (subgroups cannot have alternative meetings that overlap temporally with the TC Meeting without approval of the TCC or PC).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="policy-for-invited-guests"><a class="anchor" href="#policy-for-invited-guests"></a>5.3. Policy for Invited Guests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From time to time, OGC staff or an OGC member may wish to invite one or more individuals from organizations who are not OGC Members to attend an OGC TC meeting. Reasons for invitations may be to provide technical input, speak (see Policy for Invited Speakers below), or meet with OGC members and/or staff on items and issues germane to the work of the OGC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Invited Guests (representatives of organizations that are not members of the TC) may actively participate in an OGC meeting at the sole discretion of the TCC. That is, in the interests of ensuring the efficient operation of any meeting, the TCC may limit or eliminate the opportunity of any invited guest to participate in discussion at any meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Invited Guest invitations and registration must be coordinated with the TCC and the OGC staff responsible for meeting logistics. The steps are very similar to those for Invited Speakers.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>OGC staff or the DWG/SWG Chair provides a formal invitation to the individual with a cc to the TCC and the TC meeting support staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TCC approves the invitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OGC provides the invited guest with a registration code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The invited guest must register with the provided guest registration code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invited guests may or may not have to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). For special meetings held in parallel with the OGC TC meetings, such as an OGC Interoperability Day, summits and workshops, or a Standards Coordination meeting, NDAs are not required.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Invited Guest may or may not have to pay a meeting registration fee. OGC staff will work with the members to determine the fee structure for Invited Guests for any given TC meeting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="policy-for-invited-speakers"><a class="anchor" href="#policy-for-invited-speakers"></a>5.4. Policy for Invited Speakers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From time to time, OGC staff or Members wish to invite an individual from a non-Member organization to speak at an OGC Working Group meeting or Plenary session. Any invited speaker may attend the TC meetings for the day on which they are speaking without having to pay the TC meeting fee. The process is as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The DWG/SWG Chair provides a formal invitation to the individual with a cc to the TCC and the TC meeting support staff. The formal invitation may be via email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TCC approves the invitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The OGC provides the invited speaker with a speaker registration code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The invited speaker must register with the provided speaker registration code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the invited speaker wishes to spend more time at the TC meetings beyond the day on which they are speaking, they will need to pay the required TC meeting fee, unless waived. For the day the invited speaker is attending, they are free to partake of any refreshments but will need to pay for their own lunch or any related OGC social event they wish to attend on that day. Finally, the speaker may need to sign the standard OGC Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).</p>

<h3 id="agenda-and-schedule-of-a-tc-meeting"><a class="anchor" href="#agenda-and-schedule-of-a-tc-meeting"></a>5.5. Agenda and Schedule of a TC Meeting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At least eight weeks before a TC meeting, a draft master schedule for that TC meeting will be posted to the public OGC web site. The agenda is managed solely by the TCC or designee and will be modified prior to the meeting as appropriate. The TCC will maintain a master agenda that is available to members and which is generated from the agendas of each WG as they are populated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WG Chairs shall provide the TCC or designee meeting date and time requests at least 4 weeks before the actual TC meeting. The earlier the better!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each WG Chair shall email an agenda to OGC members at least three weeks before the meeting. Due to schedule conflicts, WG Chairs that fail to provide a proposed agenda by three weeks before the meeting may forfeit the right to meet during the course of regularly scheduled TC meeting times. However, the Chairs of a WG that do not provide an agenda can elect to have an ad-hoc meeting during the off-hours (such as a breakfast or after dinner session).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is a GoToMeeting (or similar technology) session assigned for a specific OGC Working Group, TC Plenary, or PC meeting, there is the option to record the session for later use by OGC staff and OGC members. Guidance for such recording is as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The members attending the meeting need to be notified that the meeting is being recorded. If there are objections, then the meeting shall not be recorded.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following policies address voting during and between TC meetings. One of the primary functions of the TC is to vote on a variety of actions, items, and issues. Votes can be for any purpose pertaining to the format and content of the Abstract Specification, Candidate standards, OGC standards, Discussion Papers, approval of the slate of nominations for the OGC Architecture Board, Best Practices Documents, Policies and Procedures of the TC, and for other purposes consistent with the purpose of the TC as described in these Policies and Procedures. The TC will make recommendations to the PC concerning adoption of a candidate standard, changes to a standard, creation of a Working Group, a Best Practice, or a policy document and these recommendations require further approval by the PC.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="quorum-for-a-tc-meeting"><a class="anchor" href="#quorum-for-a-tc-meeting"></a>6.1. Quorum for a TC Meeting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quorum for any meeting of the Technical Committee Members shall be 1/3 of the total Voting membership as comprised by the Strategic, Principal, Technical, and Technical Aggregate Members. If there is quorum, then a simple majority of the Voting TC Members present at a meeting shall constitute a positive vote for all TC Items and Issues. A roll call will be held at the beginning of each Plenary where votes are to occur to ensure a quorum is present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only exception for this Quorum rule is for a vote to issue an electronic vote for adoption of a new or revised version of a candidate standard, creation of a Working Group, a Best Practice, or a policy document. In this case, a simple majority vote of those TC Voting members present constitutes a successful vote.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="three-week-rule"><a class="anchor" href="#three-week-rule"></a>6.2. Three Week Rule</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For votes that require documentation, such as adoption of particular documents as standards or documents to be released for public comment, one third of the Voting TC members in attendance may invoke the requirement that documentation supporting the vote must be available three weeks prior to the vote. The TC may override the 3-week rule by a 2/3-majority vote of Voting TC members in attendance at a meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The three-week rule clause ensures that Voting TC members have adequate time to read, distribute and gather comments on documents before voting on the document at the following TC meeting.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="voting-at-tc-meetings"><a class="anchor" href="#voting-at-tc-meetings"></a>6.3. Voting at TC Meetings</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many votes happen during a face-to-face TC Meeting. Votes can occur in a TC Plenary or in any sub-group meeting. Votes may be related to document actions, recommendations for staff action, formation of new sub-groups, approval of WG charters, and so forth. This section provides guidance on the policies and procedures related to votes at TC meetings.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any number of votes can occur at a TC DWG meeting. No prior notice is required to have a vote at a DWG meeting during a TC. Any member representative attending a DWG may vote. However, only one member representative from a member organization may vote in a DWG. Any member representative attending a DWG can frame a motion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The votes that may occur at a DWG are:</p>

<p>Not every OGC TC Voting member can attend every TC Closing Plenary. Therefore, the OGC maintains a proxy process. The official TC Voting representative for an organization can assign their proxy to another full-time employee of their organization, to another individual from another TC Member voting organization, or to the TCC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proxies can be assigned electronically or in written form. The written proxy form is provided for each meeting and are sent to the Voting members via email as well as being posted to the TC meeting folder for which the proxy will be valid. Assignment of proxy to another full-time employee of the Voting member’s organization may be communicated verbally to the TCC in advance of or at the TC Closing Plenary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proxy shall be communicated to the TCC in advance of the TC Closing Plenary. The TCC shall send reminders to the Voting Members prior to the meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Proxies are not transitive: that is, if Member A holds a proxy for Member B and Member B holds a proxy for Member C, Member A can only vote on behalf of Member B and CANNOT further vote on behalf of Member C by “proxy to a proxy.”</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Has an email reflector on the OGC Portal on which all voting members are subscribed; and</p>

<p>Has a quorum rule on votes, or a rule that requires a notice to the TC at large of the type of vote being contemplated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the event that a motion is made either on the email reflector of a subgroup or in some other scheduled meeting of the subgroup (that lacks quorum and thus cannot act directly), then the chair (or presiding officer of the meeting if the elected chair is not present) may call for a Portal vote as a “measures to obtain a quorum” (RONR, 11th Edition, §40, pages 347-348). The procedure will be as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A motion is made and seconded on the subgroup&#8217;s email reflector or during a meeting (such as a teleconference) that may not have a quorum.[multiblock footnote omitted]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chair (or the presiding person at the meeting where the motion was made in conjunction with one of the subgroup’s elected chairs) announces that a Portal e-vote will be taken and summarizes the procedure to be used. This summary includes an opening date (usually immediately or within one week after the motion is made) and a closing date at least one full week after the opening, making the vote last at least 8 calendar days (such as a Monday to Monday schedule).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All requirements for previous announcements as delineated in the TC policy and procedures must be met before the email or Portal vote start date. These requirements may include posting of the associated supporting documents in advance of the vote and/or an official notice to the TC of a pending vote within the subgroup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Votes must be cast before the end of the closing day at midnight in the time zone of the voter (as recorded by the email send protocol). This mail announcing the vote shall include a formal name for the vote in the subject field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any valid voting member of the subgroup may visit the Portal page for the e-vote and cast their vote. The member may change their vote at any time. The last vote cast by the member before the closing date and time is his official vote. Portal votes do not stop until their end date is reached or the vote organizer chooses to withdraw the vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only one vote is allowed per OGC Member organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protests on the procedures involving the vote will be addressed to the subgroup chair, with a final appeal to the TCC and the membership of the TC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at least a quorum (1/2) of the subgroup votes (YES, NO or ABSTAIN) then the vote is valid. The original motion passes under the same rules as would have been required in an official meeting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For most votes that require a simple majority at a quorum-valid meeting, the motion passes only if a quorum is obtained, and the number of YES votes is greater than the number of NO votes.</p>

<p>The procedures for holding email votes presented in this section apply to any votes that the TC is eligible to hold in a Closing Plenary or any subgroup of the TC that meets the criteria for holding electronic votes as defined in Section 6.6. Note that use of the Portal electronic voting function is preferred over the use of email voting procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Email votes follow the same process as laid out for TC votes in the TC Meeting (see Section 6.4) or for subgroups of the TC electronic voting (see Section 6.6), with the following additional procedures.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The TCC or subgroup chair sends an email to the appropriate reflector notifying the group of the start of an email vote. The message must specify the item(s) on which the group is voting, include relevant background information, provide the deadline for voting, and define the type of vote (“Hand” or “No Objection”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Hand” vote: voting members email the reflector (from the email address listed for the corresponding Portal user) with the vote clearly mentioned in the first few lines of the mail, and optionally in the subject line. Allowed votes are YES, NO, or ABSTAIN. The subject line should include the formal name of the subject of the vote used by the chair in the announcement. A member may change their vote by emailing again at any time before the close of the vote. The last vote cast by the member before the closing date and time is that member’s official vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“No Objection” vote: an email vote may consist of a request to the group members for any objection to unanimous consent. Voters with no objection to the ballot do not need to email the chair or reply to the vote announcement. Should there be an objection, the vote will be paused and the objection discussed in the reflector or in a meeting. If the objection is addressed to the satisfaction of the objecting party, the vote will continue for the number of days remaining in the vote from the date at which the vote was paused. If the objection is not removed, then the vote will restart as either a “Hand” vote (see 2 above) or a Portal e-vote.</p>

The following are the usual steps related to the formation of a new WG. Typically, the first step is to call an ad-hoc meeting at a face-to-face TC meeting. An ad-hoc meeting is to 1.) judge interest in forming the new sub-group and 2.) define the scope of work for the proposed new sub-group.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you join a SWG and have voting privileges, you have a responsibility to participate in the teleconference and email dialogues. If you do not participate in the teleconferences and email discussions and vote on items and issues, you will lose your voting privileges and have your SWG member status changed from “Voting” to “Group Member”. The SWG Chair has the authority and the ability to make these changes based on the following policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to "Observer" and still actively participate in the SWG.</p>

<p>This section provides the policy and procedure for retiring, deprecating, or rescinding OGC documents. Note that retiring, deprecating, or rescinding an OGC standard results in the same fate for all extensions to that standard; such a fate is version-dependent: only the extensions specific to the exact version of the standard being retired, deprecated, or rescinded will share that fate. Deprecation of a standard does not automatically result in the deprecation of a profile of that standard.</p>

<p>The TC e-vote is to recommend to the PC approval of the results of an adoption vote.

<p>Community standard: This is a document, developed by communities external to the OGC, such as GeoRSS, that OGC members wish to bring into the OGC process.

<p>Evidence of implementation: The TC will judge whether the evidence of implementation for a particular <span class="lime line-through">Community standard or</span> standard <span class="lime line-through">with Compliance Suite</span> is sufficient to warrant approval of that standard. Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard <span class="lime line-through">with Compliance Suite</span> <span class="lime">in the Full standards track</span> is defined as three or more documented implementations that <span class="lime line-through">collectively implement all mandatory requirements of the standard</span> <span class="lime">meet the Nature of implementation criteria, below</span>.

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop a plan and schedule for completion of the new revision of the given standard. The Plan and Schedule, also known as a Road Map, will be made available to all OGC members as well as the Public.</p>

<li>
<p>Work to ensure that the new revision is – as best as can be accomplished – backwards compatible with the previous revision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At completion of revisions to a standard and before the new version is voted on, provide a “release notes” document that describes all the changes to the standard. The revised standard will not be considered for adoption until this document is complete.</p>

<p>From time to time, members and the public will discover errors in a published and approved OGC standard. In such cases, a process is required to document and publish the corrections without forming a SWG<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_30" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_30" title="View footnote.">30</a>]</sup> <span class="lime">or submitting a new Community standard Work Item</span> and that follows the formal TC review and voting process. Under the corrigendum process, an error (or errors) in a published document discovered after adoption and publication is shown with its correction(s) under a separate sheet (or addendum). <span class="lime line-through">This process is very similar to the ISO Technical Corrigendum Process</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process operates as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>An identified error is documented and submitted to the OGC using the Corrigendum Proposal (CRP) template. The submitter(s) of the Corrigendum notify the TCC.</p>

<li>
<p>The TCC or designee evaluates to candidate corrigendum to verify that a specific error is being documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TCC or designee communicates the documented error to the editor/author of the specified standard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The editor/author checks the validity of the error and then communicates this information to the OGC membership for comment using standard OGC communications. The reason for the TC broadcast is that there may be many implementations of the standard for which an error has been documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is concurrence that the corrigendum documents a valid error, the editor/author writes the corrigendum and submits back to the TCC or his designee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Membership votes to release (or not) the error (deficiency) correction as a corrigendum. A Corrigendum vote will ask if there is any objection to unanimous consent. In order to speed the process, these votes will last for only two weeks <span class="lime">or occur in a TC Meeting Closing Plenary</span> and there is no IPR review requirement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all cases of adopted standards in a revision process, the members will work to insure the highest level of achievable backwards compatibility to the previous release. In those cases in which backwards compatibility cannot be achieved, the SWG will insure that all inconsistencies are highlighted and documented. These will be incorporated into a Standard Revision Release set of notes that must accompany the new revision. Release notes document all enhancements, changes, and compatibility issues resulting from the revision of the interface standard. Both the TC and the PC reserve the right to review the issues related to backwards compatibility for a given revision of a standard. If the backwards compatibility issues are deemed too onerous, the TC and/or the PC may elect to reject the proposed revision.</p>

The existence of these groups can be misleading to those trying to understand what OGC is currently doing. This proposal suggests a mechanism for reviewing subgroups and taking some action when appropriate. This will help ensure the groups in OGC are aligned with the actual work being done within the TC.

All TC member organizations could be represented (and <em>vote</em>) at WG meetings in order to allow the expression of all members' opinions. OGC Voting TC Members are protected from control by non-voting members by virtue of the fact that WGs may only form recommendations to the TC and not final TC votes. WG minutes are also available to <em>all</em> members of the TC, so that other TC members may understand and accept or reject WG recommendations.

<a href="#_footnoteref_20">20</a>. It is felt that this most important TC vote should encompass the entire Voting TC membership, rather than a portion of a meeting quorum, to allow all OGC Voting TC Members to have control over the issue. Note that the TCC does not cast a vote in the specification adoption process as the TCC vote may only be used in the case of a tie. Under the rules of the new OGC IPR policy, all Specification votes will be by electronic vote. As such, the entire TC voting membership will have the opportunity to vote.

<a href="#_footnoteref_21">21</a>. It was felt that it is not within the TC&#8217;s purview to determine the ability or intent of an OGC member and technology sponsor to commercialize a technology. However, it was felt that the TC&#8217;s work would be fruitless without such ability and intent. Therefore, recommendations to the PC shall implicitly or explicitly include such caveats.

<a href="#_footnoteref_32">32</a>. This section clearly places the onus of protection of proprietary rights on the owner of those rights. No discussion of proprietary technology can take place during a TC or TC subgroup meeting, protecting the participants in the meeting from accidental exposure to proprietary information (and consequent future legal problems with that participant&#8217;s own intellectual property rights). If a TC member wishes to present information of a proprietary nature to members of the TC, he or she may arrange a meeting of the interested parties totally separate from the TC process and meeting.
