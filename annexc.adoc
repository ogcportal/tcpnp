The following is a list of questions that the submission team needs to answer in the affirmative prior to submitting community specification into the OGC.

1.  Can the original specification be licensed for free, public distribution per OGC policy?
2.  Is there sufficient evidence of broad implementation?
3.  Is the candidate Standard unencumbered by any 3^rd^ party intellectual property?
4.  Is there method to determine compliance with the Community Standard? This could be an abstract test suite, a compliance test framework, clearly defined requirements, or other text in the document that describes compliance.
